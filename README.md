# latex-learning-course

A **german** guide for LaTeX.

I created this repo to teach my friends LaTeX and to provide them with a simple guide for them to look up some LaTeX concepts.
This guide only covers some basic concepts. It is not intended for you if you already have experience with LaTeX.

To start the course, follow the link in the description or go to the [GitHub Pages](mobergmann.github.io/latex-course/).
